# sauc·ey[*](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=saucey)

[ /ˈsɑː-/ ] *intoxicated, drunk, or under the influence*
> Last night we went out to celebrate and got saucey at the bar off Henessy.

## What this is?
Saucey is an Automation framework written in mainly PHP. Designed to kick-ass and take names.

## What's it do?
This framework allows testers to:

* Control selenium & headless drivers with Gherkin
* Evaluate API endpoints with business-logic driven code
* Test UI elements with user-driven logic
* Verify arrangement of files and directories; availability of assets
* Set server-side, front-end and functional assertions
* Report coverage and pass-fail status of suites
* Connect test suite(s) to a continuous integration system of choice

# Get Started

## Pour a glass

Install all dependencies through composer, if you run in to any issues please see `Dependancies` below examples.

1. From the root dir run: `php composer.phar install`
2. Then `./saucey init`
3. For testing against ze *cloud*:

  - `vendor/sauce/connect/bin/sauce_connect user_name access_key`
  - `vendor/sauce_config user_name access_key`
  - `./saucey drunk @<tag> <environment> <browser>

4. For testing `locally`:

  - `./start_selnium <environment>`
  - `./saucey sober @<tag> <browser>`

## Shots! (examples)

### Local w/ [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) - Tipsy

1. Initialize saucey by running `./saucey init`
2. Start selenium via `./start_selenium mac`
3. Open new tab
4. Run a sanity suite via: ./saucey tipsy api chrome
5. Open a new finder window, then open `reports/saucey_report_api.html`
6. Press "Feature: I want to make sure this test suite is up and running" to open detail view for that test suite. You should see a bunch of tests running, like:

```gherkin
Feature: SOAP & REST API Funtionality

  As a tester
  I want to make sure api features are up and running
  So that I can automate continuous integration and regression tests using it

    @api @get
    Scenario: Make and validate a GET request
      Given send a GET request to "/comments?postId=1&id=1"
      Then  the response code should be 200
      And the response should contain json:
      """
        [
          {
            "postId": 1,
            "id": 1,
            "name": "id labore ex et quam laborum",
            "email": "Eliseo@gardner.biz",
            "body": "laudantium enim quasi est quidem magnam voluptate ipsam eos\ntempora quo necessitatibus\ndolor quam autem quasi\nreiciendis et nam sapiente accusantium"
          }
        ]
```

###Cloud w/ [SauceLabs](saucelabs.com) - Drunk

1. Initialize saucey by running `./saucey init`
2. To point **saucey** to SauceLabs, you'd need your `user_name` and `access_key`. Sign up and register for a **free** [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) account.
3. Get your username and api-key. *Should be available via /account.* Copy the info into your clipboard.
4. Open the `behat.yml` file with your favorite IDE and replace all instances of `adcadeQA:d3daa8f1-147e-4655-aa25-49606f633afa` with your username (used to log in) and api-key. Save
5. Run a sanity suite via:
    `./saucey drunk web mac chrome`

6. Then, go to [https://saucelabs.com/account](https://saucelabs.com/) and view your running/completed tests. Navigate through and download meta-data, screenshots and video recordings of the entire suite.

#### Localhost testing on the cloud

To test something on a localhost in the cloud, you can open a tunnel with sauce connect. With your username and api-key/access_key from the steps above, run:

  - `vendor/bin/sauce_config user_name access_key

To start the connect tunnel:

  - `vendor/sauce/connect/bin/sauce_connect`


###Mobile & Tablet

For iOS:

  - `./saucey drunk check ios_phone`
  - `./saucey drunk check ios_tablet`
  - `./saucey drunk check ios_tablet_landscape`

For Android:

  - `./saucey drunk check android_phone`
  - `./saucey drunk check android_tablet`
  - `./saucey drunk check android_tablet_landscape`

## Dependencies

On Mac OS X, (with the exception of LAMP for Windows) saucey requires the below dependencies. For now, the `Pour a glass` section above should cover all dependencies. However, if there are errors thrown upon running `php composer.phar install` or `php composer.phar update` in terminal you can reference the sources below. They should also be maintained.

1. [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) & [Developer Tools](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329243/xcode-4-4-and-later-install-command-line-tools)
2. [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html), see [documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-jdk.html)

4. [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) or equivalent `Windows Only`
5. [PHP](http://php-osx.liip.ch/) *of course*

# Reporting & MOAR

## Reporting

By default, reports are saved to the `reports/` directory. If you ran a suite via `./saucey drunk` or `./saucey tipsy`, you can see the report in:

  reports/

# Caveats & Issues

## Caveats

1. To use the `local_safari` profile, in other words to test against a local version of Safari, go to `vendor/saucey/drivers/`
2. And install the `safari_extension.cert`
3. Go `Safari`>`Preferences` and make sure it is enabled.

## Selenium Issues

The issues listed below are some known issues with the Selenium WebDriver.

1. Firefox ≤36.0.3 does not render ANY web driver functions from selenium, fixed in v36.0.4 with selenium
2. Most of the major web driver functionality, i.e. pressing buttons, following links are completely non-functional for the Safari Web Driver.
3. Locally, some step functionality is non-functional: `iMoveBackwardOnePage`, `iMoveForwardOnePage`,`iRefreshThePage`

## Saucey Issues

1. ~~API functionality is not implemented currently because of  aug blocking functionality.~~
2. ~~Using the current HTML output generator, there is no shell output when running `./saucey`~~
3. Dynamic reporting of error types. Steps that failed are shown, but the output is generic.
4. ~~Duplicate context and usage of FeatureContext~~

## TODO

[ ~~Done~~ / *In Progress* ]

### base tasks

1. ~~Contextualize shell functionality for reusability~~
2. ~~Change FeatureContext to WebContext of its' own.~~
3. *Make context for clicking XY coordinates*
4. *Make context for dragging and dropping with XY coordinates*
5. Load test automation with JMeter API
6. Connect to its own Jenkins CI instance
7. Dockerize!!!

### readme tasks

1. *How to write functional Gherkin tests*
2. How to write custom step definitions
3. How to add saucey to a project
4. How to add/modify yaml and composer dependencies
5. ~~Refactor and add comments to all step definitions~~

### frontend tasks
1. *get.saucey.io*
2. app.saucey.io, finish UI/UX and app skeleton
